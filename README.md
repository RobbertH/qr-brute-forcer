# qr-brute-forcer
Android app to display random QR codes of a chosen string length at a chosen speed.

I only needed to write less than 200 lines of code thanks to google's zxing library combined with journeyapps' barcodescanner library.
The relevant code is in app/src/main/java/me/robberthofman/qrbruteforcer/MainActivity.java
